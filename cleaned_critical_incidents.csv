in her room.        went back into her room and got her bedding and took it to the theater room.
Madison once again redirected her back to her room.            was refusing to go back so Madison gave a
few minutes to calm down so she could move her back to her room. Madison went downstairs quickly to
get new q-15 forms because it had switched over to a new day. She was downstairs maybe two (2)
minutes when          came downstairs to use the bathroom then headed back up stairs. Within 30
seconds the alarm sounded. Madison ran for the front door and since it was closed she ran upstairs to
check windows and doors. As soon as she got to the top of the stairs she saw the emergency exit door
was open and          was standing on the top railing. Madison yelled to Joe Garrard to help her. She
started talking softly and calmly to       to get her to get off the railing.       said she didn't want to talk
to Madison. Madison asked her who she would like to talk to and that she was willing to call any staff to
help her. By this point Joe had made it upstairs and was trying to help talk           off the railing.
started leaning back and lost her balance. Joe and Madison grabbed her and had a hold of her and
attempted to pull her back over the railing. But because          is a bigger girl and she had on slippery
basketball shorts they lost hold of her and she fell. Madison rushed down the stairs why Joe called 911
and the Program Director. Madison kept            warm with warm towels and blankets and tried to keep
her still in case she had a back or spine injury. David Scott (""D'Jay"") the Program Director show up

Madison and Joe to calm the rest of the clients back down. Mapa remained at the home the rest of the
night with Joe and Madison.

hospital. The hospital crisis team stepped in to assess        and asked D'jay and Eric if they thought we

  During their stay             has been notified of several quality of care concerns.
  Havenwood has shown a consistent pattern of inability to protect youth from eloping from the secure
  residential facility thus placing youth in harm of self. Nor has Havenwood been able to prevent youth


from being a danger to others as evidenced by youth’s 3rd offense of assault charges occurring both to
police officers and peer. Youth has had 7 incidents requiring law enforcement since admit.
There appears to be a consistent pattern of residents becoming involved and trying to manage crisis
situation situations. For example, a peer was attacked by youth when a peer tried to stop youth from
eloping. This pattern suggests a quality of care concern around appropriate staff supervision and
training of staff to manage crisis. Current pattern suggest a lack of safety and risk of harm to all
residents.
Below is the comprehensive data on QOCs regarding Havenwood from January 2018 to current, these
QOCs are from a total of 7 youth:
•     Total of 37 QOCs were reported (75% of QOC came from just two youth but they have been there
for one year or longer).
•     21 QOCs were sentinel events
•     20 QOCs involved elopement attempts
•     7 QOCs involved incidents with law enforcement, three of those the police were called by
bystanders.
•     One QOC involved       investigation due to possible sexual coercion between an older peer and
one under 12.

been causing issues all day. The patient had been making threats , making claims that he was insane,
making claims that he was going to run away, he stated that he was going to cause as much trouble as
possible, all in an attempt to get kicked out of treatment, or to have his parents pull him. Staff and
residents had been instructed by therapists to do their best not give attention to the behaviors, but if
the patient became an actual threat to himself or others that they were to initiate the appropriate
deescalation procedures.
Eventually his behavior led to him being restrained twice in the same day. The first incident occurred at
12:50 pm and the staff involved followed the correct company and PCS procedures. The patient got out
of his seat threw his chair across the commons and tried to engage in a physical altercation with staff,
Staff initially instructed the patient to calmly return to his seat, the patient refused and became hostile,
two other staff involved safely instituted a positive control systems prone restraint using proper
positive control system techniques. Staff attempted to help the patient remain calm and help him to see
reason. The patient deescalated enough that he was able to return to his seat. Staff then returned him
to his designated seat where the patient could be a on high risk watch program
Unfortunately the patient did not calm down and moments after the first incident, began to elevate his
behaviors again. Despite staff's best efforts the patient continued to make the same threats as before
and was extremely disruptive to the other patients on the premise. Around 4:50 pm the patient got out
of his seat started to pace around and claim that he was insane. The Supervisor on shift approached the
patient in an attempt to help correct the patient's behavior. The initiating staff did not follow company
and PCS policy for deescalating unruly behavior. The confrontation led to a restraint that resulted in the
patient sustaining a head wound. The Patient was transported as quickly as possible to the local
Instacare where he received medical care for his wounds. He was then escorted back the campus where

concern this could happen either today or in the next couple of days. The staff are also worried about
going to work because of these problems. They feel they do not have much control of the situation.

  constipated and she ""might be a while."" Due to            safety protocols, staff asked whether she had a
  belt, which she did not. Staff also stood with a foot in the door.
  After about ten minutes, staff asked        if she could finish using the restroom.        said that class
  doesn't start until 3:30pm and so ""there's time"". ) Over the next 30 minutes, staff increasingly asked
        multiple times whether she was finished, and that it was taking a long time, and to hurry.
  replied with ""Okay.""
  Staff encouraged        to finish up and come out so that she could pass her shift.          replied ""I don't
  care"". Staff asked her to come out of the bathroom again and reminded her how long she had been in
  the stall, which was now approaching 40 minutes.
        said she would not talk to any staff and only wished to talk with her supervisor, Cecilia, who was
  not available. Staff encouraged        to use DBT skills, and       said ""I already used the tools and they
  didn't work."" About 5 minutes later,        said ""Open the door, but please don't freak out."" Staff saw that
         right wrist was cut and bleeding. Staff also saw that the toilet had blood and toilet paper in it.
Staff radioed for extra staff to come help in the restroom. Staff rinsed           wrist applied pressure with
toilet paper. After consulting with campus medical staff, the decision was made to take              to an
instacare. She was taken by another supervisor, Lacey, and received stitches.
Subsequent investigation revealed that            (who is an assistant in the medical wing of the calf
program) had stolen two of the needles used to administer medication to calves, which she used to self
harm.          has also been suffering from constipation and is taking stool softeners for it, which was why
it took 10-20 minutes for staff suspicions to be aroused about the amount of time she was in the
bathroom.","A violation for not reporting to the office of licensing within 24 hours has been issued. Interview with

said, ""hey, time to get out"" She didn't answer, so I said ""Hey, you need to get out ok?"" She didn't
answer again. Then I saw her arms above the bathroom door shower curtain reaching toward the air
vent. I said, ""What are you doing"" and then I saw her face look at me (She was kneeling on the cabinet) I
then saw she had a rope or shoe lace or some object wrapped around her neck and it was attached to
the ceiling air vent. So I bust in there to find that she is naked and kneeling in the cabinet with a rope
attached to the vent and around her neck. With my right arm I held her arm to lift her up so the rope
wouldn't become tight around her neck. She started to struggle with me, so I continued to hold her by
her left arm. With my left arm I tried to undo the rope from around her neck. It was too tight and the
knots she made were too tough to break, So I tried to untie the knot she made up top around the air
vent cover but it was too tight and I couldn't get it untied. So I just broke the vent cover by yanking it off
from the ceiling so the tension wasn't there around her neck anymore. I had yelled at the girls to go get
Haylee and Ruth about 30 seconds earlier, and so at this point Haylee came in and she and I were able to
get the rope from around her neck off. Then a few seconds later Ruth came in and so because she was
still naked I left and went and watched the other girls. Ruth and Haylee talked with her and deescalated
her.","was moved from the program by her            caseworker due to other concerns in the program.

continued to earn the 3rd consequence due to not following instructions.              had gone around the
home towards the north side and broke 2 more windows (the office windows). He grabbed a large piece
of glass and started walking towards me. He was given firm instructions to set the piece of glass down
due to how dangerous it could be to him.
He dropped the piece of glass and began to walk towards the road. He had attempted to jump in front
of moving vehicles and throwing rocks at them. On his first attempt I did get closer to him and told him
that for his safety that if he crosses the bike lane. He will be put into a hold immediately. Hearing this,
he did cross the bike lane and I attempted to put him in a hold. The hold was unsuccessful, he did turn
towards me, twist and bit my arm. After this specific incident he ran in the middle of the road and threw
rocks at me. By this time, I saw it necessary to call 911 due to me not being able to deescalate him, him
putting himself in immediate danger and me not being able to restrain him appropriately. Once he knew
I was on the phone with 911 he traveled back to the home and broke the 3 large windows in the front of
the home. I used reality statements such as ""doing more damage will only make the situation worse
once the police arrive,"" and ""remember that            is here, and he wouldn't want you to get hurt."" Police
arrived about 4:50 pm. They had saw it fit to restrain            in handcuffs on the grass due to
aggressive reaction towards the police. Following that, I had given a statement to an Officer at the scene
and           was taken to Primary Children's Hospital.","Licensee failed to report within the required time frame and was notified of violation; no further action

 wanted to hurt herself. While continuing to discuss self harm,             and          returned downstairs
 to try to recruit other
 youths. I gave          a firm warning that if she attempted to hurt herself at all, I had been given
 instructions to put her in a
 safety hold. Instead of cutting herself, she chose to forcefully bang her head against the walls. In trying
 to stay close to
              continued to push me and tell me I would not touch her friend. Cozette C. remained close to
 help ensure both
 of the youth and myself were safe.             continued to bang her head against walls around the
 downstairs, and
 continued to put herself between me and               After getting closer to      she tried to lunge out at
 me, at which point
 Cozette C. put her in a safety hold.            had picked up my metal water bottle and hit Cozette C. on
 the head with it
 while she was adjusting          . into the safety hold, As          was trying to swing it again, I placed her
 in a safety hold
 as well. At this time, Sara V. called the authorities who were dispatched to the home.
 While the two youths were in holds, they were screaming and struggling.                  . was still in her room
 but continued to
 say that she wanted to join because she wanted to help her friends. She stated that she understood how
 they were feeling
 and she had been having thoughts of suicide for the last few weeks. When the police officers arrived,
           and
 were still yelling and struggling in the safety holds. An officer talked with        and stated if she
 promised not to run away
and to try to calm down then she could be released from the hold. She promised, and the officer
instructed me to release her. She went upstairs with the officer but quickly escalated again because she
wanted to be with             downstairs. The
officer returned downstairs with the other two officers to assist Cozette with                      continued
to scream and
struggle in the hold as the officers tried to help calm her down. After several minutes, she was able to be
released from the
hold. During this time,               was discussing with Sara V. and a responding officer about ongoing
thoughts of suicide.


             reported to Sara V. and the officer she had a push pin and a pen in her room that she had
used for self harm.
The items were confiscated.
          was on the floor in front of the bathroom talking with two responding officers. She was observed
to be frustrated, and
still discussing self harm.         reached for an officer's gun stating she wanted to use it to hurt herself.
At this point, the
officers grabbed her hands and placed her in handcuffs. Both officers carried            up the stairs and
placed her in the car
to be transported to Jordan Valley Medical center for evaluation.
During this time,            was upstairs with Cozette C., stating that she wanted to die, that she had too
many bad memories
in this home, and she wanted to go to UNI. The officers determined that               would be transported
to the hospital to
receive an evaluation from a crisis responder.
After finishing discussing her suicidal ideations with Sara V. and the officer, it was determined that she
would also go to
Jordan Valley Medical for evaluation. After all three youth were taken in the police cars, Cozette C.
followed to be with the
girls during their time in the hospital.

began to quietly talk about how they were going to tell all the donors at the event how horrible the
program was and try to sabotage it. Raymond had the girls go outside to take a break for a moment and
get them away from the Gala as both of them were refusing to follow instructions. Outside they both
reported how much they hated the program and that the company took them away from their family
and that they didn't want to come. The girls continued to struggle outside and would continue to run off
but would return when Raymond asked them to come back.                 then reported that she needed to
use
the bathroom. At that point both         and          talked about peeing on a random guys lap and
laughed about it. Both tried to use the restroom at the same time but              was willing to follow
instructions in the end and stayed out. Once the event had finished the girls continued to take off
together into different shops at the hotel and eventually ran off together. Raymond and Elida escorted
the kids that were following instructions back to the car and was about to call police when they got a call
from Bobbi that they were in the gift shop but were still unwilling to follow instructions. They than ran
off into the Hotel away from Bobbi. Bobbi spoke with hotel security who looked for the youth. At one
point an individual had the girls waiting in the ball room but the girls took off from there and ran away
from hotel security at one point they yelled for help saying the security guard was going to rape them.
Due to this security asked for additional assistance. Outside a police officer spotted them and spoke
with them. Both girls reported to the police officer that staff at the home were sexually abusing them.
Police officer questioned Bobbi about the accusations and then spoke with Joe, the home supervisor.
During this the girls were holding each other and kissing each other on the neck. The police officer than
spoke with the girls for some time. Eventually the girls followed the police officer's instructions to get in
the van. On the way home the two girls continued to huge each other and were unwilling to follow any
instructions that were given to them. They began to kick the seat in front of them and had               and
        crying.         asked them several times to stop and that her back was hurting but they
continued along with pulling on their seat belts. At one point            punched         in the head and
then continued to try and punch her as            blocked her punches with her arms.             than grabbed
          seat belt and started pulling on it as hard as she could over and over again to the point you
could hear the seatbelt. Due to the girls ignoring all directions up to this point Raymond yelled at
         telling her to stop and that she needed to think about what she was doing.              than yelled
back at Raymond telling him he should die. At this time both             and      stopped kicking the chairs
and pulling on the seat belts.          than began to cry saying someone should kill her because she
could not control herself and than began to apologize to the girls in the car for how she was treating
them. Several of the girls expressed that they were still scared when they got home. All the girls in the
home took their medication and went to their rooms.",,/Users/wcraft/apm_reports/code/troubled_kids/data/source/All RTC docs/Utah Youth Village/West Jordan Latency Home/Latency Home - critical incidents/westjordanlatencyhome.clientassault.111319_Redacted.pdf,2019.0,2019.0,2019.0,2019.0

her swimming suit before going outside. Her                 had called and tried to talk to her and she
refused. She than ran off saying she was going to a friends house. The neighbors turned her away and
she took off. Elida tried to find her and was unable to. After several neighbors were contacted and she
was not found the police were notified. a neighbor called to notify us that she was in the neighborhood

refused at which point both I, DS, and KM tried to encourage him to go to his session with reality
statements and positive motivators. After a minute a few tries it became apparent that                   was not
following instructions. At this point     earned a negative 20. After this      cussed at me and started
hitting at which point I called a 5 second and refused to go to his room and continued to try and
fight off    I tried to encourage with positive motivators and i didn't work so earned a first
consequence of 100 points and         earned his second consequence of 100 points. At this point, both
youth continued to show aggressive behavior that escalated when I stepped in between them.                 was
the one who showed the most aggressive behavior being that was just laying on the ground at the
time so I performed a hold on        I asked KIm to inform Joe at this point. While in the hold,       started
screaming and started demanding that I let            go and threatening to jump me while I was on the
ground. I let know his actions were getting serious and gave him a firm instruction to go to his room.
    started grabbing my leg at which point I did not feel comfortable enough to remain in the hold with
    any longer. I stood up and immediately taught a second consequence of 100 points to              Both youth
joined efforts at this point and started flipping couches over.       found a long rod that was used to carry
the curtain that had fallen last week and took it apart. What remained were four metal rods, each about
3 feet in length that both youth used as equalizers. I stood across both youth with only a couch
separating me and the youth and both of them started swinging the metal rods at me and threatening
to throw them. I continued to try and give both youth reality statements and give firm instructions and
both youth continued on. Two metal rods were thrown at me, one hitting me in the arm, and the other
making its way into the kitchen near Kim. At this point, I let Kim know that if she felt unsafe that she
should lock herself in the therapy room. After she did this, both youth started coming after me with the
metal rods in their hands. I then locked myself in the restroom until I heard them step away and then
joined KM in the therapy room. From there, we monitored the boys who had barricaded themselves in
the living room. Joe S arrived shortly after. At this point, JS tried to give the boys reality statements as
well. The boys threw the same metal rods at Joe. Joe pushed the table out of the way to get into the
living room with them. Joe was able to disarm         and put him in a hold. He did so in a spot where the
Christmas tree had fallen above them and I tried to lift the tree off of them. As I went to do this,
began to cry hysterically, and      went to rush JS. I then put     in a hold as well. was put in a hold for
what seemed like 10 minutes. He was quickly able to gather himself and go to his room immediately
afterwards. I sat in a hold with     for what seemed like 25 minutes. Most of the time          tried pinching,
clawing, and kicking me while trying to escape. KM repeatedly helped me by placing pillows in between
his hands and my stomach. I sat        up and we remained in a hold while sitting for about 20 minutes

schedule on getting started on study time. I told him that he would most likely be missing out on wiggle
time in order to finish his full hour of homework. After doing this he started complaining with me at
which point he earned a first consequence. After this, he went around and tried to unplug the other
boys laptops in hopes of preventing them from doing their assignments online. I advised Tyson Moore to
take the boys to the therapy room so that they could finish up their homework in peace.            earned a
second consequence at this point for not following my instructions to grab his skill card and sit on the
couch. Once he saw the boys were leaving the room, he continued to argue and started to become
violent. First he started throwing pillows at me, and shortly after started picking up anything else he
could find lying around. I quickly started to put anything valuable I could find away. He found my flannel
and threw it outside. When I asked him to go pick it up, he grabbed the hose and started to smack it
instead. He earned his third consequence at this point and went back inside. He argued the entire time.
When he got back inside, he started to pick up pencils and metal vents to throw at me. I did my best to
keep my distance and give him simple instructions. He hit me multiple times with things, as I couldn't
effectively block 100% of what he was throwing. Eventually, he went outside and I followed after with a
pillow because he has a history of attacking staff's vehicles parked out front by throwing rocks at them. I
did my best to act as a barrier between him and the vehicles. I stood in front of him with a pillow to try
and screen what he was throwing at the cars as well as deflect what he was throwing at me at point
blank. He was picking up rocks that are found across the street along the sidewalk about the size of
small pears or really large strawberries, approximately 3 inches in diameter. He hit me with these rocks
in the face once, and other times in other places throughout my body including my leg and stomach
area. Once he realized that he wasn't able to throw the rocks with enough accuracy to hit our cars from
where he was standing, he shifted his focus to the neighbors vehicles. At this point, I called Kyle and
requested permission to call the police. He started to throw rocks at a white truck across the street
putting some dents/chips in their vehicle, and then he started throwing rocks at the neighbors houses as
well. I did my best to stand in front of him and offer him other options of things to do to help him
deescalate, but he continued to yell at me and throw rocks at the homes. He threw many rocks at one
home in particular, mainly at their garage doors putting many dents all over both of their garage doors.
While this happened, a neighbor came out and started to yell at           to stop. He began to yell at her
and continued throwing rocks. I informed her that the police were on their way, and then called them
myself. When           heard I was on the phone with the police, he began to scream at me and ran back to
the home and locked me outside. Tyson opened the door for me, and I followed him into the kitchen.
        started to pick up the pencils he had previously thrown at me to throw them again, along with
plastic jugs he found in the kitchen. When I went into the kitchen to put things away in the pantry,
picked up the hose from the kitchen faucet and started to spray me with it. I jumped into the pantry and


closed the door after getting soaked and kept the door slightly cracked in order to maintain line of sight.
I waited here until        put the faucet down. At which point I ran out to put my hand on the faucet to
prevent him from soaking me again. He collected a ton of things to throw at me and jumped back onto
the counter to try and spray me again. I had a pillow in one hand and the other on the faucet. I tried my
best to deflect things but couldn't block much. He threw a pencil into my eye point blank as hard as he
could which left me unable to see much for a while. At this point I felt comfortable enough proceeding
with a hold but chose not to because he was on top of the counter and I didn't want him falling off and
getting hurt. He grabbed anything he could find in the sink and threw it at me including a wet dirty
sponge while calling me names and flipping me off. The police were still on the line with me on speaker
while I had my phone in my pocket and dispatch told me police was almost there. When             heard
that, he ran to the front door and locked it. Occasionally he would unlock it and scream things out the
door targeted towards police. When they finally arrived he ran downstairs and opened a door with a
faulty lock and hid inside the library downstairs. Cops came in and he calmed down a bit. He finally took
his morning med which he had refused to take for over a couple hours. We consulted with a pharmacist
before giving him the med to make sure he could still take it. He finally calmed down, finished PC's, and
went to his room for quiet time at 2:45 pm.","This investigation has been combined with others at the Utah Youth Village. The investigations at the
Beverly Taylor Home, West Jordan Latency Home, and a violation at the Lyla home have been combined

pulled her hair without warning and no antecedent. At this point              earned his second and third

started yelling more profanities at the staff. He then walked away threatening to pull the fire alarm
down the hall. I sat with            as I kept eyes on the Zook's who had eyes on           and tried to
consult him with reality statements. I heard          scream at staff calling them ""nigger"" and ""bitch /
bitch wad"" multiple times. When finished doing PC's with          I joined the Zooks. I learned that one of the
times that         had yelled bitch he had opened the door to the church congregation and screamed it
inside towards everyone present.               then got close to         who was demonstrating aggressive
behavior so i tried to stand in between them.           stopped threatening to pull the fire alarm after
Justyn notified him that it would be a very big fine from the police should he choose to do that.
then started threatening to go damage the cars in the parking lot. Instead of going outside,              found
a door that was unlocked and entered that room. I forced the door open with my foot reminding
that I needed to assure his safety by having to keep eyes on him at all times.            then found some
metal folding chairs and threatened to hurt me with them by picking them up and gesturing that he was
going to throw them at me and or hit me with them. I gave him a firm instruction to put them down and
come out of the room. He then put them down and got very close to me threatening to punch me by
putting his fists in the air and gesturing like he was going to punch me. He put his body on me with his
fists balled on his way out of the room. I stood in my non-threatening defensive pose with a hand in the
air ready to block any potential punches and           tried to bite my fingers at this point.        left the
room and found a public phone which he attempted to call his mother with multiple times. While doing
this he made various threats to staff. He eventually put the phone down and walked over to Andra
gesturing that he was going to hit her while verbally stating he was going to do so. I gave him reality
statements and gave him a simple instruction of walking outside multiple times. He finally did so and
grabbed a jug of salt he found at the entrance. He started pouring the salt all over the ground and then
all over three AC units he found outside that belonged to the church. Justyn came out and joined us
outside.         made multiple threats to Justyn and Justyn told him that if           were to hit him that he
would have to call police and press charges. This didn't stop                   proceeded to assault Justyn.
Justyn did his best to deflect punches and kicks and biting and spit and his neck tie from being grabbed
and a shoe being used as an equalizer while talking to police at the same time.             tried to reach for
Justyn's cell phone multiple times. Justyn did all of this while walking away trying to keep distance from

while using his shoe in his hand and throwing it at me multiple times. I did my best to deflect all of this
while backing up and trying to create distance between us. Shortly after           stated that he was going
to go inside the church and find Justyn. I followed behind to make sure bystanders were safe.
found Justin and spit in his face again. From here he tried to attack him again and then backed away
from Justyn to get a drink of water. He then filled his mouth with water and chased after me with a full
mouth wanting to spit it on me. I was able to keep enough distance for long enough to have to swallow

followed him back outside, where at the exit he found a shovel and picked it up and threatened to
attack me with it. I continued with my reality statements per usual and he laughed at me calling me a
pussy and put the shovel down. From here            went and laid on the grass next to the van across the
parking lot and I sat watching him outside from the side of the church until police arrived. Police took
our reports, spoke to          mother and recommended to her that she try to admit him into the state
hospital. Having spoken to the police, the first thing        did after being put in the cop's SUV was brag
about his past criminal activity citing the time he stole a Tesla and drove it on the freeway before having
to be taken to the state hospital before coming to the Youth Village demonstrating no remorse for any
of his previous actions.","Program appeared to take appropriate action and are offering more support to the family teachers as

Eventually she did and we were able to drive home. After arriving home she continued to refuse to
follow instructions and struggled speaking with a calm voice. She made several threats saying she was
going to hurt Raymond. Objects such as two bars she had in the Lila room were removed and she was
left to calm down. After checking on her a few times she came out on her own. Raymond kept his
distance but made sure she was in view at all time. She first went downstairs to            room where
they started passing notes. One of them said that they loved each other. Raymond asked her to stop
talking to her and sit on her bed and listen to music. She complied and stopped talking to her.

provided several rationals but still opened her door to Lexi who went in.       told Raymond she does not
have anything to look forward to. Raymond tried to remind her that she complied with a visit at the
facility which meant there was a good chance the next visit could be off site if she started following
instructions but she refused.          than came out of her room saying she no longer wanted her radio
and wanted to join them and refused to listen to staff.       pulled out some paint she had hid from staff
and had serenity throw some of it on Raymond. They than did the same with some lotion and other
products they had which included perfume and bubble solution. They made several comments about
sex. At one point       said that          wanted to have sex with Raymond.         than told          to
throw a pair of shoes at Raymond which she did. Eventually         talked        into giving her the boots
she had on and threw those at Raymond. They than tried to close the Door and lock it. Raymond pushed
the door open. One of the other youth in the home needed to use the bathroom and              threw
something at her as she was going into the bathroom. The girls than packed up and went out
Bedroom window. When Raymond got outside they were already gone. After driving around for about 5
minutes the police were notified and Raymond continued to drive around. When the police arrived at
the home Raymond went back home to help give a report. Later that night            called from the Smiths
saying they were cold and ready to go home. After arriving at the Smith's they were seen coming out
with food that they had purchased. The police officer that had been helping arrived. She asked to speak
with them and explained why it was unsafe for them to run away.           and        were observed to
listen while          was observed to talk back to the police officer. On the way home they admitted to
asking people for money and purchasing junk food saying they had a lot of fun. They reported that at
one point           had removed her shirt to get $50 from a person they had met. At home              asked
to do corrections first and went inside the house and then        did corrections.          while doing
corrections reported they were not done and had decided they were going to come home and act like


they were done and start up again. While talking to her about this she went to               window and she let
her in. They continued to refuse to follow instructions and at one point                started to massage
       thigh right below her vagina. They then all three were in the bed together ans                  was
observed to continue to touch           but Staff could not identify where as         was in the way. They
refused all demands to stop what they were doing and the crisis line was called. They told Raymond that
he needed to follow their protocol and let their caseworkers know.             than tried to close the door and
Raymond opened it again. She than used a belt to hit Raymond over and over again. Eventually
Raymond went into the room and took the belt away and placed it in another locked room.                   than
found some of her underwear and threw it at Raymond she than went to                     room and found her
underwear and did the same. She later found an egg that she threw at Raymond and                        threw a
tomato at Raymond. Raymond continued to remove himself from them and they followed him outside.
     threw several things at Raymond which included a salsa bottle.                 than gave a glass bottle of
sauce to            and told her to throw it at a girl's window that was following instructions. She did and
broke the window. They than took part of the broken window and climbed back into the home through
       window and pushed their way into                room and surrounded her.             was found curled up
in a ball crying with all three girls standing around her. All three girls were informed the police were on
their way and they needed to leave her room immediately which they did. That girl was then moved to
another room to keep her away from the three that were not following instructions.                     began to
cry saying she did not want the police and          was comforting                       was then observed to
massage          thigh again and Elida this time gave them the direction to separate. They refused to
follow her instructions and began to kiss. The police arrived and tried working with the girls. After
getting information on what had happened and seeing they were refusing to still follow instructions they
looked at ways to separate the girls. DT and the JRC refused to take them and a detective was unable to
come out. They contacted            and it was decided to take             to the Christmas Box House. After
she was removed from the home.               went to her room crying and         continued to refuse to follow
instructions.        than decided to continue to not follow instructions and the two of them started
smashing plastic serving cups and shoving them under some of the girls doors and tried breaking into
some of them. They then grabbed some spices. As Raymond was keeping an eye on them following
them up and down           threw salt at Raymond getting it all over him and in his ear.        than continued
to do this and Raymond used a pillow to block what he could.             and        continued to pull spices out
and throw them at Raymond and then throw the empy bottles at him which some were made of plastic
and some glass. Several made contact with his face and some with his side.              was observed to laugh
as she did this and continued to tell          to help. She than pulled things out of the fridge that she
threw at Raymond and also took frozen items out of the freezer and threw those. The supervisor arrived
at the home and            was observed to be compliant and went to her room.             was still refusing to
follow instructions but went downstairs and convinced               to Join again. They continued to throw


spices and other food at Raymond and his supervisor (Joe) Joe asked Raymond to wash his face off as
the spices were burning his skin and eyes. As Raymond was washing his face off he could here crashing

at Joe and then Raymond. Joe tried sneaking out the front door and coming to the side and             told
       to watch the side door while she continued to throw glass where at Raymond. Joe directed
Raymond outside as        continued to throw the plates and bowls. Raymond shut the front door and
held it shut so she could not throw the plates at him. She than started smashing them against the glass
window of the entry door trying to break it. When it did not break she came out the side door and told
       to watch the door while she threw plates at Joe and tried to hit him with a hose. Raymond went in
the front door and locked it behind him. He than went to the side door where he found               blocking
the door. Raymond told her she needed to move and she needed to move now.                   quickly went
outside and Raymond locked the door behind him. The top floor was covered with glass and both girls
did not have shoes on.        took the bottle that was used to break the other girls window and broke her

DETAILS
              was placed at Synergy Youth treatment voluntarily following his continue acting out
behaviors, suicide attempts and his adopted parent’s inability to keep him and others safe. Parents
retained custody of this child:
•    When placed at Synergy, paperwork was completed detailing approved contacts for
•    A handbook was provided detailing rules and expectations. Synergy’s written guidelines state that
upon reaching a certain level,        earned the ability to contact his family on a weekly basis. Also, that
parents were to attend a weekly therapy session in Cornish, but due to the distance, phone therapy was
an alternative via video chat.
•    Synergy is a youth home, and its many male teens clients are a mix of violent offenders and more
trouble non-violent youth.
•    Shortly after arriving,       bio-mother (who was clearly listed as an unsafe person) contacted
Synergy and removed all of         s family from the approved contact list, and substituted her contact


information. She got           whereabouts from         s sister who was living at home when he was
placed.
•     During         earned weekly phone call home, staff contacted             bio mother and primary
abuser while he heard everything. He was extremely upset and revealed this to                when they were
able to talk later.
•              informed Synergy of this and insisted that Synergy’s very own protocol be followed.
Synergy stated that it was a new staff and therefore an unfortunate but unpreventable error.
•     Almost immediately,           phone calls were withheld. He seldom called home, and always when
monitored. When             complained, she was informed that this was simply and industry wide problem
that resulted from not having sufficient staff available to place a weekly phone call.
•     Shortly after arrived at Synergy,        reported that he was injured by another resident who
shoved a table into         scratching his abdomen and causing pain.           reported this to          who
in turn discussed this during the weekly therapy sessions.          was chastised for telling Parents instead
of informing staff privately.
•     One male youth at Synergy claimed to identify as homosexual, but was left with the other youth
and not offered protections nor separate showing, sleeping space for his safety.
•     Another residents room was searched, and a plastic “shank” was found, thus creating fear in
     reportedly          peers as they felt unsafe.
•     Synergy had many off-site activities that included, bowling, camping, swimming, fishing,
community park parties, shopping etc.
•     Youth were supposed to be visually supervised at all times! However,             and a peer stole a knife
while left in the community unsupervised – stating they feared for their safety.
•     An adult staff member was fired and allegedly charged, for physically assaulting a minor resident
        presence.         reported this to his parents. When questioned, synergy referred to privacy laws
and refused to discuss this incident or its affects upon
•            reported to parents that while camping, he was left unsupervised and he and another
resident left camp and meet up with a female in the camp bathroom.               reported kissing her. Parents
reported this to Synergy where it was denied. Later, synergy admitted that it had happened and that it
was impossible to monitor the youth during the over-night camping trips. Parents insisted that
     not to attend these trips until he was able to be appropriate, as it was this behavior that had landed
him in trouble to begin with. And that grief over his actions was the root of his suicide attempts.
•     Team meetings were help at Synergy that included              PO Ms Kelker. At those meetings,
treatment plans were discussed, and family visits were planned with              Therapist in attendance
making recommendations.
•     Shortly after parents began to complain about            safety,         received a text (which I have)
stating that the director was cancelling          home visits citing it would create problems with the other
boys. Synergy required youth to be on Level 8 to have home visits.             visit was scheduled for AFTER
       was on level 8.


•              contacted all team members and objected, stating that only the team together should
make these decisions, and not a director who was not present during the meetings. Director reversed
course and “bargained” for             to have one home visit, but that he would not allow any further visits.
          asked what she or          had done – as this seemed punitive and director stated there was
nothing other than his personal feelings. BTW – that director is also the owner and thus in a position of
financial gain for residents to stay.
•     On one occasion A Synergy staff member handed                 his personal cell phone and walked away.
Then Synergy staff called            PO to report that          had violated his court order by having said
phone.            alleges it looked like        and his family were being set up to fail for reporting safety
concerns.
•     During           stay as Synergy, the very public event occurred: two youth took the keys to staff
members car. Those youth stole the car to flee and ultimately crashed the car. She remained employed.
•            also experience an incident where other youth were allowed to enter the private shower
area, turn off the lights and also assaulting           with a trash can.
•     Synergy’s policy was that youth were never to be unsupervised. However, staff again left the youth
alone to watch movies. During one of these times, the youth (including                 began to “moon” one
another. This led to charges against             In addition, Parents were NEVER notified by Synergy.
was interviewed by the police, with Synergy maintained they were his legal guardian and prevented
       from calling his parents, or PO during questioning.
•     Again left unsupervised, youth attended the local gym. The youth carried gator-aide drinks and
chose to pump Hand sanitizer into their drinks in an alleged attempt to “make alcohol”. This lead to one
youth losing consciousness.             alleges staff was not present, and that         ultimately sought help
for the youth. Medical services were not called, and the other youth were never interviewed. Staff took
the youth to his private car and drove to the hospital.
•     Parents reported this to Synergy and informed them that               alleged there were at home alcohol
making supplies in the boys’ rooms. Synergy dismissed this allegation again – leaving                as a “rat” in
the midst of his peers.
•     Parents were contacted by Synergy and an incident report was created when                    was once again
physically assaulted by another client – this time with injuries.
•     Parents attended Therapy with              and his new therapist at Synergy. When the topic turned
         assault, therapist demanded that parents leave immediately.               began to cry and beg parents
not to leave, he also stated he wasn’t safe and was scared. It was noted that Talon was injured during
the assault, medical attention was not sought for him and he has a permanent scar.
•     It should be noted that           did NOT fight back. Instead he was punched in the face several times
and stated that he knew if he defended himself, he would lose the privilege to return home. In addition,
the incident reports that an adult was presence during the assault but was allowed to intervene because
she didn’t have the proper training. This seemingly was a failure to protect.
•              called the next morning to make an appointment to visit with                A privilege outlined in
the synergy handbook, and one which had occurred on other dates.


•     Instead the new director of ONE WEEK, pulled               into the office and spent ½ hour demanding
that she apologize for causing           distress and forcing her to rehearse the words over and over
before allowing her to contact            The words were – I apologize for my behavior that has caused you
to feel unsafe. It is my fault.
•     During this visit,        reported that therapy was very helpful and he knew he was able to learn,
but that he was physically unsafe.           stated that he wanted to remain at Synergy so that he wouldn’t
violate court order and end up starting over in another group home.
•             contacted Synergy and requested that they have a meeting concerning physical safety
issues. This telephone meeting was arranged between                 and the new director.           sent an
email (which I have) detailing the concerns to             safety and requested that this be discussed.
•     During the lengthy phone call that I will not detail here – director continued to address his thoughts
on          mental health treatment and refused efforts to direct the conversation to physical safety,
phone calls and home visits.
•     Director stated that           mental illness was a direct cause of being in the home with disabled
siblings. – he even once used the word “retarded” to which               took great exception.
repeatedly stated that the call was to discuss            safety and that all treatment plans were for TEAM
decisions and that team include PO Natalie Kelker who                repeated stated “was in the drivers seat”.
This new Director stated that he was cancelling all visits and contact between             and family due to
having these types of siblings in the home.
•     After hanging up,            contact Ms Kelker with concerns and also Aubrey Meyers (DCFS clinician)
for help and redirection, as they are both part of            team.         was given the information that
she had the legal right to remove           from Synergy over documented concerns for his safety and
alleged abuse.
•     Parent           contacted Cache county police to inform them that Parent               was traveling to
Synergy to remove           and wanted to maintain peace.
•     New Director called            after the police arrived to made several remarks that            alleges
were attempts to threaten her into leaving            at Synergy. Director stated that if         insisted on
removing           Director had a “duty to inform” the police that          was a violent untreated sex
offender whom was going to be unsupervised in the community.                    offered to provide the phone
number to him in order to help him make his call. He then switched to claims that he feared for the
other children’ safety.           asked what         has done that would cause them to be unsafe? To which
the director stated that          had done nothing, but that           would be the subject of his call.
again offered telephone numbers to help him call CPS but that she wasn’t turning around and was
coming to get
•             arrived at Synergy to find two police officers present.            asked the officer to allow her
access to        to which they refused. During this time, director and owner were frantically calling every
agency and person they could to prevent             from being removed from Synergy. Ms Kelker was one of
those calls.          waited over an hour – finally         was released from the locked section of Synergy
where he had been held. (officers have recorded body cams)

and after multiple times of being asked to not hold onto his face he was redirected with further
consequences

so he could have a break and he slapped        n in the face harder so Glen placed him in an approved
standing PRT. Glen attempted crowd control to lower stimulus and had no success so he escorted to
the gym as to not escalate any other residents. After five minutes was calm and no longer fighting. He
made a plan to go upstairs so Glen released one arm and 30 seconds later released the other arm.
turned around and swung as soon as his arm was free, Glen blocked and then swung again cutting his
knuckle on Glen's teeth while he split open Glen's lip.
Alex moved to initiate a PRT but wasn't successful and after about a minute advanced on Glen before
turning on Alex and taking a swing at him. Glen and Alex initiated an approved standing PRT but just as
they were about to fully engage it ran across the gym and punched Glen in the side of the head.
freed himself and and Glen backed away keeping an arm out to keep distance from as he continued
to try and assault them both. After a few times of both Alex and Glen being slapped finally listened to
the constant verbal deescalation by staff when staff told him he wasn't in a restraint he stopped
advancing and stopped trying to hit staff.","The program has not been indicating an actions planned or actions taken section on incident reports.

the time was Super Smash Bros in my Nintendo Switch. He was frustrated that he had to wait to
play until it was done. We finished up and he went to play. Another resident attempted to help him
with his controller. He apparently thought that resident was trying to take the controller away from
him. He then hit that resident in the head several times before staff could separate them. Staff then
attempted to verbally deescalate him. He was was still upset and threw the joy con/controller on the
ground damaging it. Multiple staff tried to talk to him as he paced in the foyer and upstairs. He
calmed for a little bit until he escalated again and hit staff. Staff then initiated an approved standing
PRT and escorted him into the gym where multiple staff and residents assisted in helping him calm
down.
Once he was calm he went upstairs where he was OK up until 7:30pm. He was down in the gym at
this point and had been horseplaying with           . He got upset at    and threw some punches at
him, one of which made contact with            's mouth. He calmed down again after that. He apologized
to      later in the shift for hitting him.
An hour after this incident        came downstairs still frustrated from the earlier incident. Chris was
trying to verbally deescalate him however his attention was diverted to          who was starting to
escalate. That's when        punched him in the back of the head. He separated from staff and went
upstairs to his room.","The program has inconsistencies in the behavior management training for crowd control. Staff are
trained to remove non-involved clients from incidents. Multiple staff confirmed that this does not
happen and video footage reviewed by investigators supports that.

was damaging/defacing property in his room. His behavior escalated later in the afternoon after he used
a broken metal piece from a binder to threaten staff. Once the metal object was removed he was
escorted into the hallway away from the other boys in the room. Once in the hallway he continued to be
assaultive. During this restraint received an injury to his jaw in the form of a laceration when he was
moved to the floor in order for staff to secure a position that would inhibit his ability to cause injury to
staff (approved sit PRT).",Corrective Action Plan Received and accepted on 6/12/19.,/Users/wcraft/apm_reports/code/troubled_kids/data/source/All RTC docs/Synergy Youth Treatment/Cornish/Synergy Cornish - critical incidents/synergyyouthtreatmentcornish.physicalintervention.050119_Redacted.pdf,2019.0,2019.0,2019.0,2019.0

who was not involved, switched out to talk to him and deescalate initially. He became agitated and
began to threaten staff so he was offered a way to just sit down and vent off his frustrations. A peer
approached him and tried to distract him with other things which was unsuccessful.         then ran up the
big room stairs yelling that he was going to hit Shawndi.       was placed into an approved standing PRT

Glen transitioned into an approved sit PRT with Tom on his legs. After several attempts to talk       out of

   then punched        twice and     punched him in retaliation. Before staff could intervene      and
   threw one more punch at each other. Shawndi stood in front of          and walked him back away
from the other boys toward the kitchen. Some of the other boys had come down into the big room
and were yelling things at      .   got upset and threw a couple punches toward the boys. He then
punched Shawndi in the head which caused the other boys to immediately escalate for hitting a
female staff.    ,    and     ran up to where      was being held back by Shawndi and        and

for physically pushing staff. Caleb was attempting to verbally deescalate        in the big room. When
continued to act aggressively Caleb explained that         needed to take a break for a few minutes and
then he would talk to him.       followed Caleb and aggressively shoved Caleb from behind. Caleb
continued to try and help him calm down. Scott and I were standing next to
    punched Caleb in the jaw at which point Scott, Caleb and I initiated an approved prone PRT. Before
his arms could be fully secured he punched Scott in the back of the head twice. A nearby resident went
upstairs to inform one of the other staff that a restraint was going on.       and      both heard this and
went downstairs. When         saw      in the restraint he immediately walked toward where the restraint
was occurring. Caleb saw       approaching and disengaged from          Caleb attempted to hold his hands
out and get      to not escalate but      ignored him and started throwing punches at Caleb. Caleb quickly
pushed       back onto a couch and held him there so he couldn't throw more punches.           stopped being
assaultive at that point.
     then came into the same area and was attempting to push past staff Tanner. This escalated            who
then began resisting the restraint with Caleb again. Shawndi and Tanner tried to keep           away from
the PRTs with      and          paced around the room waiting for an opportunity to get past staff. When
he was able to he jumped onto the couch and on top of Caleb where he then tried to choke him. Tanner
and Shawndi were able to pull         off Caleb and he then went with Aaron who had come into the room.
Scott had control of     so I helped secure        legs.    was in the PRT for 7 minutes.     for about 5
minutes. Once calm was restored and the boys released they went upstairs on safety. After about 40
minutes       and     came downstairs against direction from staff.        walked down into the big room,
approached Caleb and immediately punched him in the face. Caleb and Michelle then initiated a PRT on
         was standing next to Caleb and after        punched him he ran up to Caleb and tried to choke him.
Caleb had to disengage from        who took advantage of that and tried to choke Caleb. Caleb was able to
get loose from      and went to help with the        restraint.     fought the approved 3 man PRT for a few
minutes.      stayed calm in his restraint with Michelle and was released.        went with Aaron into the
front office.","Corrective Action Requested, Corrective Action Plan Received and Accepted.",/Users/wcraft/apm_reports/code/troubled_kids/data/source/All RTC docs/Synergy Youth Treatment/Cornish/Synergy Cornish - critical incidents/synergyyouthtreatmentcornish.clientassault.050819_Redacted.pdf,2019.0,2019.0,2019.0,2019.0

Licensee Follow-Up
Actions Taken by Licensee:
I instructed Rebecca to call 911. After     recovered from the headbutt he quickly got up and ran down
the stairs saying he needed his meds. Another resident said something to upset           and    tried to
engage him physically. I quickly initiated an approved standing PRT however we ended up stepping
backwards and fell into the chair where his elbow ended up going into my ribs. The PRT was maintained
until the EMTs and Sheriff's department arrived. (Kirk)
Actions Planned by Licensee:
    was taking to the hospital to tend to his head injury after he eadbutted me. He was evaluated by a
crisis worker after self-harming (scratching his wrists) and expressed thoughts of suicide. He was found
to be safe to return to Synergy and was transported back by Synergy staff.

When         stopped breathing, staff gave         CPR, and it's not clear whether this was necessary since
staff confirmed that       still had a pulse. Staff checked for responsiveness and signs of life, but did not
check for responsiveness to pain by doing a sternum rub of something similar. Staff reported that after
about 30 minutes of        intermittently breathing and staff returning to giving CPR when she stopped


breathing,         coughed and returned to breathing normally. She initially was not talking, but was
safely on her side in the recovery position. Staff did a full head-to-toe assessment, which initially
revealed some pain to the sternum (likely from compressions), but no visible deformity or discoloration.
         therapist communicated that          has a history of faking seizures with her family, so it's not
clear if this incident was more behavioral than medical, although it was treated as a medical emergency.","Staff reacted to situation with focus on saving client's life though in review it is difficult to determine if

according to administrative rule and coached Mr. Stewart on how to find and fill out the Covid-19
incident report should they experience additional positive cases at any of their facilities. It was explained
they would be receiving a violation for failing to report within the required time frame. Mr. Stewart and
Ms. Thomsen stated they were now aware and would ensure they were in compliance moving forward.

description of the violation and the link to the reporting webpage. Mr. Stewart provided New Haven's
infectious disease policy, Covid-19 protocols they follow and collateral information. It appears no further
action is needed at this time.
On a side note, this investigator noticed that New Haven has not submitted a critical incident report
since 04-2020. This investigator pointed this out to Ms. Thomsen and suggested she speak with her
team to ensure they are reporting critical incidents according to administrative rule. Ms. Thomsen
advised that she and her team meet once a week to discuss incidents and to the best of her knowledge
they have not had any critical incidents since 04-2020. I asked Ms. Thomsen if she would like a list of
critical incidents to help her team determine what needs to be reported. Ms. Thomsen said she would

The YHA Eagle Academy Group Home went on a group activity on July 30, 2020. They went hiking at the
Adams Canyon. On the way down,               and other youths were running down the hill and             fell
and hurt his hip. After returning to the group home,             complained of the pain and was taken to
the Insta-Care in Layton. The doctor checked him out and informed them that                 has a bruised
hip (hematoma) and should treated by applying an ice bag and a heat bag to his hip (switching the bags
back and forth). A followed up appointment was scheduled for today (8-05-20) and the doctor told staff
and              to continued applying the ice bag and the heat bag until the bruise is gone.
             informed Thomas that              has a rehab appointment tomorrow. Thomas will complete

Koleton took a few hits until I reached out and placed           in a CBM hold placing him to the ground.
continued to punch both myself and Arden trying to resist for several minutes. After several minutes
         then
began to comply and lay on his stomach. Koleton using the pendulum theory started to cope with
         and ask
him why this even happened and why he was so triggered this morning.               said it was because he
was
kicked off of the school computers for looking up things he was not supposed to. He said he felt
embarrassed
and did not want to go to school anymore in this program. Koleton continued to deescalate              and
tell him
everything was going to be OK and asking him if he had any injuires, which he reported he had a rug
burn on his
arm and his arm was sore. Hunter will be placed on freeze until he can meet with his therapist and
further
discuss his consequence. We also called South Sanpete dispatch to report the incident which they came
and
reviewed and interviewed both             and myself of the incident.

quietly to soothe him.             calmed, and Aaron released the hold. About 20 min later he escalated
and was frantically trying to find any object he could. He got a cup and tore it apart trying to cut himself
with the piece of plastic, threatening to run and kill himself. As he tried leaving, Aaron placed him in
another hold until he calmed again for about 5 min. About an hour later                 escalated again.

  alleged that staff there used violent restraints against residents - such as placing their knees in the
  residents' backs and chests. She said that when she was there a resident got a broken nose from a staff
  member. She also said that she had, at one point, fractured her wrist but that staff would not allow her
  to seek medical attention to get it treated. She said the group home is so bad that it should be shut
  down. If she didn't eat all of her food, then she would get a day added to her stay there. She said that


she was require to write 5 pages of ""virtues"" each day and if she didn't she would be punished by adding
more days to her stay. She said they were only given 5 minutes total to bathe and brush their teeth.

north_star_treatment_center_north_star_treatment_center___critical_incidents,Health & Safety Concerns - 11-10-2018,2018-11-12,2018-11-10,2018-11-10,2019-01-08,"Summary:
1) Dr Fuller requests the students to write in there biography of the first time they have masturbated in
detail and all the emotions they had during the event. He has told some of the students to masturbated
while at the treatment center. There have been a couple students that have brought this to my
attention with concerns that they refuse to continue there therapy with Dr. Fuller as they have them
feeling extremely uncomfortable.             Wrote a letter to me stating how uncomfortable he felt having
Dr. Fuller as his therapist. He has refused therapy since the incident. Also,
          have confirmed that they were asked to do the same.
2) Restraints. The students have reported that the staff restrain them for any reason such as when the
student wont get out of bed, or if a student wont pick their head up off the table. The staff also hurt
them such as the dislocated wrist that              claimed happened last night when he was asked to get
out of his bed and as soon as he stood up was restrained and thrown onto the floor and claimed his arm
was aggressively twisted higher up into his back even tho he was complying with the orders, this is the
first thing        and           both addressed when woke up this morning.              stated to me that he
was concerned that restraint is now threatened as a punishment even in the event that they are talking.
3) The staff will allow students to fight or let fights go on longer then they should and the staff also
vocalized that students deserved to be punched or deserve to be in fights. There have been instances
were the staff has delayed breaking the students up when the fights began allowing the dight to go on
longer then it should have. This is a concern to a couple of the students that if there was to be a fight
involving them staff would not stop in a timely manner.
4) Medical Care - some of the boys had broken fingers/ hands and did not see a doctor.
has an infected toe and Insta-care stated he needs to go the Wound Clinic due to the infection and it has
been about three weeks and he has yet to go. The students gave themselves tattoos by pulling staples
from the wall and using ink from a pen.             finger was infected and no one gave him medical care.
The students were scared and cut them out.


5) Staff training - no staff training was provided for PCS training. There was a false PCS certificate made
for every staff. The last training was in may. Until today 11/10. Most staff do not have their BCI and are
working directly with students. I have requested that I am not scheduled or labeled as a lead staff and
they have took it upon there self to schedule me as such anyways. I am let with staff that doesn't have
BCI clearance nor do the have PCS training and I personally have not been trained to take on a lead role.
It is not something I am comfortable with as my direct concern is the safety of the students.
6) The office manager -                 - verbally and physically abusive. I have discussed this with   and
he has done nothing about it. She was fired in June for verbal abuse and for providing students with
cigarettes.      allows her husband and kids to come and go as they please without any background
clearance.            and                  both have a criminal record for embezzlement and for
impersonating a police officer and are currently under investigation for contributing to minors. ( Please
request camera footage on October 24th between 3 PM and 6 PM in the school room for proof of
physical aggression).
7) physical location -
• Broken window in building B - the             was picking up glass pieces and hiding them (11/10). This is a
huge concern considering students are on suicide watch.
• Rust and mold in each bathroom. The building needs to have an inspector look at the floors in the
bathrooms and laundry rooms.
• Bathrooms - some of the showers do not have shower heads on it
• Med room - does not lock properly, the students could break in easily
8) Therapy- the students receive about one hour of group therapy a day which is led by any staff. The
students also receive one individual session with Dr. Fuller once a week which may last up to 40
minutes. Family therapy was reduced from one time a week to twice a month. The students have
expressed that Dr. Fuller and Katina will discuss each students treatment or issues they had during
therapy as a form of embarrassment or punishment.
I had someone take over my shift today as this facility and the things that going on within are not up to
standards that I feel comfortable supporting, I have decided it is in my best interest not to continue
working there as it is causing anxiety attacks and a great deal of stress to see them dealing with such
distress. I don't feel that it is morally or legally correct and as a mother of 6 boys I'm very concerned. I
have decided no longer to continue my employment with NorthStar. I do apologize for the delay in
getting this complaint sent, Blake Tingley request to send this Tuesday however I have been able to get
online with my own personal business and collage. I strongly encourage you to interview these student
individually as they would be able to Express these situations as well and I know that you would be able
to reference there surveillance tapes to witness these situations personally. I do understand there


concerns of intimidation and retaliation of no moving forward with there program. I can also warn you
that Joe and his office management are very stern about covering there tracks with whatever they need
including falsifying documentation in order to cover themselves legally. Staff has fear of retaliation of
both         and      when speaking up with concerns as Joe does not keep confidentiality.","lack of behavior management training resulted in unwarranted restraints. all staff have now been

a youth treatment center. It is located in La Verkin, Utah called North Star Treatment Center.
1: A patient named                 was sprayed with a can of Lysol, by staff                 , for farting next
to him.                often pretends to restrain and horseplay with                   even after being
asked to stop by the patient because he felt uncomfortable. He will often put the patient into a head
lock for no reason.
2: One of the patients by the name of                     contracted hives on his neck. The patient had hives
for a few days and staff                and                 told the patient he would be fine and that they
would go away. This patient was not taken to the hospital until one night he complained of having
trouble breathing and an ambulance was called. Administration told staff not to worry about the patient
because they thought he gave himself the hives on purpose and that they would be no threat.
has a foot deformity and he often has pain when too much pressure is on his feet from jogging or
walking for too long. The patient was forced to run laps outside by staff                 and                 .
When the patient complained about the pain in his feet from running he was cut off by staff and was
forced to keep running or be punished with manual labor. The student was punished anyways. When
staff found out the patient was going to write a grievance on the matter he got punished even further by
having privileges taken away.
3: A patient named                        was restrained by staff                and                  for
leaving the presence of staff. During the restraint           cut            cheek with her nail.
wrote a grievance on          and nothing was done about his cut. Staff member,                     , used a
scalpel to try and remove a wart from                hand without any training or knowledge of wart
removal. The patient did not sustain any injuries from the attempted wart removal but the attempt
should have been handled by a professional.
4: Another patient by the name of                  has been berated by emotional abuse from two staff
members,                and                 . On multiple occasions,                has hidden under


          bed and behind             door to jump out and scare him. This has caused the patient to become
untrusting and very “jumpy” around others. Crude comments are often made about                 in front of
the other patients. One comment made by                     to        “What’s so funny, did you think about
the first time you had sex? Oh wait, you haven’t had sex.” Other comments made by                     and
                pertain to         being told to go “look in the mirror because of how ugly he his.” And
comments about how he is going to be “a lonely virgin” for the rest of his life.
5: Patient                    felt very uncomfortable when                  made a sexual comment to the
patient.                   comment was along the lines of telling the patient that the orange shorts the
patient was wearing made his penis look big.

interest is for the betterment of these patients.",Program has addressed rule violations.

  checked the

broken into the

felt like the incident could be handled with consequences in the program.

to a juvenile problem at Storm Ridge Ranch located South of Marysvale.
When the officer arrived he met with Darren Swalberg, one of the administrators of the school.
Swalberg explained that a letter had been intercepted from a                            to his parents
claiming another student had touched him inappropriately. Swalberg said the incident was to have
happened approximately two months ago and
there was no record that such an event had ever been reported to staff, that is why the officer had been
called to investigate.
The first student that the officer spoke with was                         a witness. Swalberg sat in on the
interview as well.        explained he had been staying in the room crossed the hallway from               and
his roommate                                  at the time of the incident. He said he would watch during
the night when staff would do night checks and several times he saw the two boys run out of the closet
and get back in their beds when staff came around. He said once he heard                   say to stop, it was
against his religion. He never saw what the two were doing while in the closet.
Next was               he said the two would go in the closet and touch each-others butts, this happened
several times, he said at one-point        inserted his fingers into              anus and another he
inserted his penis. He said he was uncomfortable with what was going on but even though he felt peer
pressure to engage in the acts he said the encounter for the most point was consensual, he also stated
       had touched his genitals with his hand but at no time was there any mouth on genitals
engagement during the “play”.
Lastly       was brought in and talked to,         said the two had gone into the closet and touched each-
others butts but he claimed it was               peer pressuring him to engage in the acts, he said
            had inserted his fingers inside of        at no point did either boy insert their penis into the
other and no mouth on genitals ever took
place, he also denied either boy touched the other’s penis with their hands. He also stated that even
though he was uncomfortable with the act it was consensual.             claimed he had told staff about what
had taken place as well as his therapist, he did admit his conversation with his therapist was no so much
to wage a complaint but more for therapy reasons.","No evidence of abuse.          also unsubstantiated their investigation. Proper staffing was verified.

Kevin Puzey. Kevin had prepared a lesson on ‘division’ with the agenda of speaking about the Civil War
and slavery. Kevin had prepped for this class and asked Group Leader Robert Vail to speak with the boys
about some his life experiences. Kevin was aware of some of the issues the boys in this group were
having regarding the use of racially inappropriate language between each other and so he knew to be
extra aware while teaching. The boys were having a difficult time in general that day and some were
struggling with paying attention in class as well as some personal issues. Boys were in and out of class
and staff were doing their best to manage them safely. At some point student           comes back into
the class and starts verbally attacking student for something had supposedly said. Apparently, the
students became upset with because he was accused of saying a racial slur and this upset them.
Student      walked out of the class after yelling at and when           came returned, he went directly
to and began yelling at him. (It was not confirmed who made the racial slur. Kevin heard someone
but did not know who said it.)


When             came in and headed for        staff Robert stepped in between              and and attempted
to redirect           and to protect     Kevin stopped teaching and stepped in to assist afraid that was
going to stand up and go after             All the boys started getting mad at        Staff Shirley and Robert
tried to get           to walk away as Kevin became concerned that was going to take after                     For
     protection           placed in a PRT hold in hopes to keep him safe and away from the other
students. Staff Shirley took a hold of              arm in hopes to coax him away from           At this time
          began yelling and both              and           walked towards Kevin and                  managed to
hit in the forehead while               continued to yell. Staff attempted to remove both                and
from the room but that created a struggle between                           and the staff in the doorway.
    still being held by Kevin, yelled something at either             or          when         jumps up and
charges across the room after               is stopped by student           who was sitting quietly in his chair.
          breaks free from the staff and charges back into the room heading for                    again stops
          from attacking as Robert chased                 in attempts to stop him as well. Once           was
stopped by            he turns and begins throwing tables and chairs as additional staff respond to the room
to assist. Asst. Group Living Director Wyatt Bendall is one of the responding staff. He sees Robert
attempting to control               attack on and immediately determines                   is the greatest threat
and needed to be removed from the room. Wyatt attempted to place                       in a PRT hold to escort him
from the room however,               was able to pull one of his arms free. Wyatt was still able to maintain a
single arm PRT hold and some control of                and removed him from the room. As Wyatt was
escorting            out of the room three more staff enter the room and were able to get the remaining
students removed and calm. Wyatt wanted                    away from the situation as quickly as possible as well
as not left in the hallway, so he escorted             down the hall and into his office where other students
were not around. Staff Nathan was in the hallway and was able to maintain a visual on Wyatt and
          in the office.         continued to struggle, yell and tried to pull away from Wyatt all the way to
the office. Wyatt decided to place              into a sitting position on the floor however in the process
          dropped his body weight knocking Wyatt off balance and throwing himself onto his stomach.
While on the ground Wyatt re-positioned himself and went to place                    into a behind the back bent
wrist in hopes to gain better control and start deescalating. Instead,               pulled his arm away from
Wyatt and in the process, Wyatt felt several pops from                   arm. Wyatt immediately reacted to the
sound and straightened                arm laying it on the ground gently. Both Janzy and therapist Aubrey
Sullivan walked into the office and Wyatt immediately told them to go and get nurse Amber.
Amber responded to the room where                   and Wyatt were in and accessed                 arm. It was
determined              needed to be seen by a doctor immediately and was transported by staff to insta-
care for further examination. The examination showed that                     elbow was dislocated and broke.
The doctor fixed the dislocation. An appointment has been set up for surgery on Friday to address the
break.            was returned to the facility and given appropriate care. After Amber made the decision
that           needed to be taken in she called               mother and let her know             was being taken
in for medical attention. Clay Spencer,               therapist also called the mother and gave her more
information. She has also been given full details of the examination and treatment.
At 12:07pm today I called          and gave them a full report of the harm to                arm. Brittany, the
               reported they are opening a case on the situation.","In review of the information provided by Three Points Center all of the staff involved had the necessary
training in Handle With Care. Further they are implementing a relationship based training to build
relationships with staff to help the youth calm down faster and be less restive to redirection.
When Wyatt was attempting to use a control hold from Handle with Care he was standing and
attempted to go to a seated position. As          was pulling away during this attempt his elbow became
dislocated and fractured. The       case against Wyatt was not substantiated. It was determined that he
acted properly in the situation.",/Users/wcraft/apm_reports/code/troubled_kids/data/source/All RTC docs/Three Points Center/Three Points Center - critical incidents/threepointscenter.clientinjury.111319_Redacted.pdf,2019.0,2019.0,2019.0,2020.0

this evening and were not listening to staff’s direction, creating tension with the staff. The staff
members present were Group Leader Ben Warth and Youth Mentor Sanders Wilkinson. During the
course of dialogue staff members were frustrated that the students were not following directions, were
loud, yelling at staff, and yelling student to student. The yelling volume was very loud. Staff were
verbally engaging with students, and the students were not compliant with staff. Students are running
between rooms, and the shower area, disregarding staff directions to calm down.
                 verbally challenged Ben and Sanders.            walks into his room and began to open the
bedroom window. Ben told               to move away from the window and not to open it. These dorm
windows are alarmed and have a distinctive pitched sound when they are tampered with or the
windows are opened.              ignored direction to get away from the window and not open it. As
refused to follow Ben’s directions, he opened the window. Ben ran towards                 as the window was
being opened. Ben wrapped his arms around                 pulling him back and then transitioned to a PRT
hold.

accusing him of placing his arm around his neck.             and Ben banter back and forth, as Ben
attempted to use the wall and sit with            while in the PRT hold. Ben missed the wall and
passively resists and does not sit down. Ben stands back up with Ben still holding the PRT.
Gerson Cruz, Group Lead in Dorm-2, hears the window alarm and enters from the connected middle
dorm. Gerson scans the room and sees Ben in the PRT hold, goes to assist and grabs                  legs. As
Ben is still standing with the PRT hold, and           legs are taken down by Gerson,            goes straight
to the ground landing on his bottom. Ben, having no support on his back falls forward, folding               at
the waist. In the movement forward, Ben also loses the PRT hold.
Ben then places his arm across            face, covering his nose and mouth, while trying to transition
        to his stomach. At this point          bit Ben’s arm.         is transitioned to his stomach with Ben
sitting on top of          body while Gerson is straddling on            waist and legs. As         bites Ben’s
arm, Ben pulls his arm back and punches             in the face, striking him in the area of his right cheek.


The environment was still hostile not only with         but the other students in the group. As additional
support staff are in the area now, they began moving students out of the area and handling students
who are potential risks to themselves and others.
The students were removed from the dorm and              was still on the ground being physically
restrained as he continued to escalate and not comply with staff direction. Group Leader Gerson
assumed the position for Ben, as Ben left the dorm area and assisted with the remaining students in his
group.         finally de-escalated once Ben left the dorm area. He became compliant and was
eventually permitted to return to his group.","This investigation was coordinated in conjunction with other investigations. There were no client rights

trying to runaway so they alerted staff with another group who were near where             was running.
Matthew King and Kafira Stapleton (staff who were with a nearby group) chased her down. Once
Matthew and Kafira caught up to           they verbally commanded her to stop.        ignored their request
and kept running. Matthew, because of the safety risks related to running out into the desert alone,
initiated a PRT (Primary Restraint Technique used the Handle With Care protocols) and began to escort
her back to her group. Easton Schroff, the shift supervisor, by this time was about 20 yards away from
Matthew, Kafira, and           Easton reports he witnessed Kafira talking to     trying to de-escalate
while Matthew held her in a standing PRT to prevent her from running away again. Easton reports he
also began talking to        to help her calm down.       then began to put up a serious struggle with
Mathew and the PRT. To keep everyone safe Easton took               left arm and Mathew took her right arm
and they assisted her to the ground using a bent wrist hold. Once on the ground           calmed down and
became compliant . Thane Palmer, Program Director, who was on campus, was called over. He spoke to

hurt and that if felt like her elbow hit a rock when she was being brought down to the ground. On
inspection a fist size rock was found on the ground where          had been brought to the ground to keep
her and the staff safe. Thane asked Easton to make sure          was taken to the nurse's station to have
her elbow looked at and to make sure Amber Davis, RN, the medical director, was alerted to

elbow. On 6/12/19            elbow was looked again by Amber. Amber noticed some swelling in the elbow
so she had       taken to Instacare in Hurricane so it could be examined and x-rayed. The x-rays showed
there was a small break in the elbow. The doctor told Amber that the break was consistent with what
can happen when the elbow is hits a hard object and had not been twisted. An appointment was then
set up with an orthopedic doctor to examine the elbow. The doctor set up an MRI for            to evaluate
whether or not surgery was needed to ensure the elbow healed correctly. In the mean time the doctor
recommended that             elbow be kept in a sling.     had her MRI on 6/25/19. After looking at the MRI
the doctor is recommending           have surgery to ensure proper healing of the elbow.

and student                had been, ""jacking each other off on the floor between their beds"" during
sleeping hours a few times over the last couple of weeks.        also reported to Wyatt that he never
forced         to engage in the sexual behavior but had, ""manipulated him a little bit so he would do it
with me."" Additionally,       described to Wyatt how he and           timed the sexual behavior between
the room checks so they would not get caught. Wyatt immediately moved              to a different boys
group and contacted both student's therapist, Garth Lasiter. Wyatt also reported the issue to Craig
Butcher, Group Living Director, and Thane Palmer, Program Director. Sunday evening Wyatt made sure
that       remained with the other group during sleeping hours. Monday morning Garth, Wyatt, and
Craig met to review the information. During that meeting is was determined that              needed to be
interviewed to corroborate the information.           was interviewed.           confirmed         report
and added additional information-that he and         had engaged in oral sex during a couple of their
episodes. A determination was made in consultation with Katie Soli, Clinical Director, that, based on the
student's reports of sexual behavior and in consideration of            age, 13, a mandatory reporting
situation existed. Therefore Monday afternoon Garth Lasiter called the Washington County Sheriff's
Dispatch and made a report. Garth was informed that the information would be turned over to
and that they would contact Three Points Center. Parents of both students were also called by Garth
and fully informed of the issue. A plan was developed to ensure the two student cannot communicate
with each other.","student was groomed by another student and there was too much consistency in nighttime routine

said ""No, that the teacher was doing attendance and trying to get class started"".
The teacher was interviewed by the Director of Risk. When asked if he had observed what had
happened in his class he was under the impression that the patient had fainted on her own. He had
given no indication that he was aware of horseplay during his class. He was also asked if there were
potential witnesses to the game. He stated that                      was in the back of the class with the
resident who had fainted.
          was interviewed by the Director of Risk and indicated that she did not see her peers playing the
game. She stated that she             slipped and that's what caused her to hurt herself. The Director of
Risk told this peer that it was important to be honest because the individuals involved had already
admitted to playing an inappropriate game. At this point,           stated that she knew nothing about it
and indicated that she truly believed that          slipped and hurt herself. When asked if she thought
her teacher knew or observed the incident she said ""No"".
Actions Planned by Licensee:
Camera footage is not present in the classroom. Footage can not be obtained.                will be moved

provo_canyon_school_provo_canyon_springville___critical_incidents,Complaint,2019-12-31,,,2020-02-10,"Phone call complaint from current PCS Employee. She wanted to stay anonymous. She has decided to
quit because she does not feel it is a safe environment for herself or for the children there and has many
concerns with how the facility is ran.
Concern 1: Understaffing
Yesterday through last night she worked all night by herself, 16 girls and only one staff- She was on the
Provo Cottage last night. She knows there was only one staff of lightning cottage last night as well.
When the state came in two weeks ago, they announced over the radio that everything had to stay
where they were and no one could leave yet. She did not want to lie and thus she left as she was no
longer on shift.
She works the swing shift from 3-11pm. Night shifts have been only there are one shift for 2 cottages.
Girls report that night shift is sleeping during the shift.
She is leaving because in the past few months she has to work by herself and if a fight broke out there is
nothing that can be done. When a fight occurs, she just moves the girls into another room because she
cannot do anything. When incidents occur there is no one to respond.
One of the girls told the state that the manager was lying to the state and said there were 4 staff on
shift however there was only one. The other staff were leaving.
Doesn't feel the kids are getting what they need, always hearing that the therapist is too busy or always
gone. Kids are asking the line staff to do the therapist jobs.
Started being understaffed about 6 months ago, the agency is trying to lie to the state regarding their
ratios.
Concern 2: Nursing
Nurses don’t seem to help the girls at all. They always say to wait until med pass to get medication.
Student had a bulge on her neck and the nurse practitioner took a few weeks to see her
Requested that a student gets another bag of ice for her mouth that was hurting and the nurse did not
want to give the girls another bag of ice. Feels like the nurses are lazy.
Nurse practitioner: Keith
Feels like Keith ignores the kids
PCS offered bonuses to people on salary pay to work on shifts. The office people don’t know how to
work with the patients. This has been happening for the last 2-3 weeks ago. Don’t give line staff any
bonuses, but give office staff bonuses to work. Does not feel like this is safe because office staff don’t
know how to work a radio or do restraints.
Kids had to clean up sewage from the pipe. Kids had to clean it up because the toilets had been backed
up. She called maintenance and had to snake the drain. Both bathrooms and the hallways were flooded
with “poop water” and toilet paper. Maintenance said that the girls can clean it up. She helped the kids
clean. One of the girls got sick the next day. Lightening cottage. About 2 months ago this happened.


Staff member brought alcohol to work and found it in the office. Becca worked, always late, came in 5
hours late. She was giving on the the girls nicotine gum and texting her boyfriend. The girls said that
there was alcohol in the bag and took some and put it back. She is unsure if management knew about
the alcohol incident. Becca was fired because she was an unreliable employee.
2 night watches were fired because they were drunk on shift, she cannot remember how long ago this
happened.","This complaint constitutes a critical incident due to the safety issue of not having enough staffing. The
program has submitted a Corrective Action Plan to address this and other violations from different
investigations. The office will continue to monitor the progress of the program during the CAP period.",/Users/wcraft/apm_reports/code/troubled_kids/data/source/All RTC docs/Provo Canyon School/Provo Canyon Springville - critical incidents/provocanyonspringville.staffcomplaint.123119.pdf,2019.0,,,2020.0

REPORT:
The referent reported that                    (primary) ran away from the Provo Canyon School and ran into
traffic and tried to kill herself. She was admitted to Provo Canyon Behavioral Hospital on 3/13/2020 (she

hair, twisted her wrists and pushed her down to the floor harshly.            did not specify the last time
that this happened, but the referent believes that            ran away because of this.         explained
that she had told other members of staff (unknown if this was administration or just other staff) and her
social worker about this situation and said that nothing has changed since disclosing this. The referent
did not observe any marks, bruises, or any other forms of physical harm to
         also stated that these members of staff have ""threatened"" her and have told her things that
lower her self-esteem. She said that they have said things like ""you're ugly"" and ""shut your mouth"" to

 Worked for a year, does not have a designated cottage
 Last night there was 10 staff on shift and most staff were watching girls on their own. Tonight will have
 20 staff because the state is coming in.
 The last few months they have been running between 10-16 staff, 110-114 students


When the state comes they will have adequate staffing on site. On a sunday, the state came in at 4pm
during shift change and the program made the staff that were suppose to be leaving stay so it looked
like they had enough staff on shift.
A few girls attacked a staff some girls evening and the staff was sent to juvie

Unsafe for the girls and for the staff members

forcing themselves on others,                  mother pulled out of treatment)
The other evening, girls were throwing stuff in the room and he was the only staff on the cottage. Sup.
radioed him to sit down and that he is watching the camera and got his back- staff did not feel safe.
Girls broke a window and the glass everywhere. Waiting on maintenance and had the girls in the office
with him while they waited for the glass to be cleaned. Manger leaves and then the girls tried to rush
him. Hard to feel supported by management.
Good times for the state to do unscheduled visits:
State visits: saturday or sunday between 5-8pm

Leslee and Kelly,
Just an f.y.i. The complainant wishes to remain anonymous. However, he is fine with being contacted.
He just doesn't want his name on the complaint he is available until 2:30 PM - 11:00 PM today and
tomorrow.
The complainant wishes to remain anonymous. However, he is a current staff member and he is stating
that the facility is ""unsafe"" and they know that we are going to inspect tomorrow and that they are
""amping up"" staff to look like they have more staff. However, they are short staffed and that usually
they only have 10-16 staff and it should be 24 staff. They complainant states no one is safe and currently
there are about 110-114 residents at this time. Recently, 2 residents choked a staff member with
curtains. The staff knows they are coming in the morning or Thursday morning and they are planning on
being prepared for the visit. The complainant is concerned with safety of residents/staff. The
complainant has obtained injuries himself.
The complainant may quit. However, the complainant is worried about the residents there.
The complainant is okay with me letting Manager know of his name and number and work schedule to
call him if he has further questions.
Thank You,

the situation is dangerous for staff and clients. Indicated that this past Monday he was on shift with one
other staff and had 3 girls in serious situations that they couldn't address all at once (one self-harming,
one disassociating and one in fetal position having abuse ""flashbacks""). He indicated that at any given
time the ratio in daytime is 2:16. He knows of a girl on swing shift who was alone for 4 days. This past
Monday at 1:00pm there was a riot resulting in 16 restraints.
He recalls that last summer the ratios were always around 4:16 and sometime in Feb/March things
drastically changed and haven't been above 2:16 with every night consistently with only one staff:16 on
duty overnights. He knows of staff who have worked 4-5 double shifts in a row.
He went on to describe 2 recent incidents where staff have been injured by the girls and is most
concerned about the 12 year olds who are placed on units with sexually acting out 17-18 year olds with
only 2 staff. He was eyewitness to the girl having a seizure and nursing staff relying on the video footage
instead of coming to see her in person. He is willing to speak with investigative staff and asks that we
stop in to do ratio checks at 7pm and midnight to get a ""real feel"" for what the staffing situation looks
like. He also encouraged us to read the ""comm logs"" because everyone documents everything in there
and there is no coercion to change or omit any details. Investigations staff advised to contact Mr. Biren
and do multiple nighttime visits to assess staffing ratios. If PCS cannot adequately staff the facility to the
needs of the population, they will need to decrease their census to a level where they can maintain
adequate staffing.","The agency completed a client survey as a result of the client and found a violation regarding staff
treatment of students. Violation and program response is listed in the CAP. This will be reviewed and
monitored for 90 days once the CAP is approved.",/Users/wcraft/apm_reports/code/troubled_kids/data/source/All RTC docs/Provo Canyon School/Provo Canyon Springville - critical incidents/provocanyonspringville.staffcomplaint.111519_Redacted.pdf,2019.0,,,2020.0

fight peers. During the afternoon shift she was refusing to follow structure and yelling and cursing at
staff. Staff began to prompt the patient. The patient continued to ignore staff and isolate in the corner.
Staff then observed the patient walk over to the window and start pushing on the glass. Staff continued
to prompt patient and she would not listen. At this point, staff Lina walked over to the patient to guide
her away from the window. In response, the patient became combative. As a result staff was scratched
on her face and arms. She attempted to place the patient in proper HWC but due to the level of
aggression from the patient. was unsuccessful. Nursing evaluated the patient following the restraint
and she had a small scratch on her chin. She was treated with basic first aid.","In reviewing the video and discussions with PCS risk managers, it is clear that the staff acted outside
of training and did not complete a HWC appropriate hold. PCS shared concerns and the supervisor
was moved to a different unit and no longer works on stabilization. They also re-trained the staff on

about the incident he was upfront and stated that he was in an awkward position and did not feel that
he had a really good hold on her. He did not want to readjust as she was combative and did not want to
be hit. In regards of the hair pull, he stated he did not feel that he did but did not remember. As we
pulled up the camera and watched the video he then stated that he did do it, but did it to regain
leverage as she was pulling away.
At this particular moment, I told him to utilize Dustin who was in the common area at this time to assist
him in regaining in proper HWC hold. In no way should we use the shirt, hair or anything of the students
that going to cause hurt or harm to the student. He was receptive to this as he also stated that he didn’t
think he scratched her.

noticed a few students wanting to use the bathroom multiple times in a row. I became suspicious of that
activity, and stopped everyone from going into the bathroom. I overhead a few kids saying there was
something in the bathroom. I then called Jim Cheney (program owner) and Tarris Laupapa (house
manager) and they showed up. Tarris searched the bathroom, and Jim searched the residents. Nothing
was found. We talked to the kids and questioned them but no one would admit to anything.
During treatment team on Tuesday, Tarris suggested that we drug test the kids that were going to and
from the bathroom. He suggested we do a surprise test on Wednesday morning. On Wednesday
morning he took samples of the residents. Later on that day I, Jim Cheney (program owner) was out on
activity with residents. I received a phone call from Heather Allred (program director) and she stated
that she had been told by             that             had confessed to being dirty. I then brought this up
to the the boys I had with me, and asked if any of them would be dirty. Immediately                 (
resident) told me he would be dirty, as well as                  (resident), and
(resident) also admitted to being dirty. He also said that he had brought in a substance which he shared
with the other youth after his home visit last weekend. That evening when the tests arrived, we tested
all of the urine samples. All the youth that had admitted to being dirty, were dirty, also
(resident) who did not admit to being dirty, also failed his UA. We talked with all the youth the next day
and                        continued to claim that he had snuck in the drug. As the day went on,
           came to Heather and told her he needed to talk to her. He told her that he needed to take
accountability for bringing in the substance and said it was methamphetamine. He had been on a home
visit the weekend before. Please see follow-up report regarding another youth                  from Tarris
Laupapa.
At approximately 8am I Tarris Laupapa (house manager) overheard some students claiming that
      (student) was part of a group of kids that had used meth in the student restroom. I informed
treatment team about what I had heard and they decided that               should be tested. At
approximately 9am we tested              and he failed for meth. I informed        that he had failed then
he admitted that he was part of the group of kids that was snorting meth in the student restroom.","Licensee failed to report within the required time frame and was notified of violation; no further action

  Tarris, Pine Ridge house manager, informing that          had cut his arms. Tarris stated that the nurse
  was going in to look at it. This              stated if he had called his mother,           to notify her
  and he stated he was going to call her next. At approximately, 18:00, I, Daniel Zea,                       ,
  received a text message from Michelle stating that Heather Allred, Pine Ridge therapist, had missed
  their scheduled family therapy. Michelle asked this                 what was happening with           and
  she needed an update because Raphael,             mentor from Foundations LLC, informed her that he
  visited       earlier today at the program and saw his cuts, stating they were “pretty bad”. This
             immediately called           and she informed this                 that no one had called her to


 inform her of           incident nor did they call yesterday to inform her of         first attempt in cutting
 his arms. This                  provided all the information and updates to              After ending the
 phone call, this                 called Thomas Smith, supervisor, to explain to him the situation. Thomas
 Smith stated he was going to inform Manu Taeoalii, APD. As this                      was talking with Thomas,
 I sent Tarris a text message, “Has          been seen by medical?” He replied, “Nurse was going in to look
 at it.” I responded, “        needs to be taken to an urgent care today to be seen.” He replied, “I’ll see
 what our nurse says.” This                   then received a call from Raphael, describing his afternoon visit
 with          Raphael stated he was concerned about             He stated his arm looked like shredded
 wheat and the cuts looked deep. This                     asked if it was bandaged and if it looked like it was
 seen by a nurse. Raphael stated that he had not and that while he was at the school visiting, his arms
 were exposed in class for everyone to see. While on the phone with Raphael,                   messaged this
                  that Heather informed her that          had yet to be seen by a medical provider. At
 approximately 19:10,               messaged this                 that she had messaged Heather to request
         to be taken to an emergency room. While this                     was on the phone with Raphael, a
 text message was sent to Tarris asking for an update on              status. At approximately 20:25, Tarris
 responded that Heather had taken              to the emergency room at Sanpete Valley Hospital. At
 approximately 21:50, this                   asked Tarris for an update and replied, “the only update I have
 is mother saying he’s getting staples.”
 Sounds like the youth was evaluated by a social worker at the ER. The youth was claiming this was more
 of a self harm situation versus suicidal ideation so that is the reason he was not committed. It sounds
 like this started Sun and progressively the cuts got worse or he dug into the cuts and made them bigger.
 He used a razor out of a shaver and hid the razor. There is another youth involved in self harm that is a
               that I do not have a name on.                   did not find out about any of this until
 yesterday, and he was notified by the mother. He was pretty frustrated about the lack of
 communication.              and his supervisor will be going down this afternoon to check on the youth.","After reviewing incident reports and conducting interviews with all parties. The Licensee seems to have

keys or I will stab you"". Collin told           to give him the knife and to knock it off, which he did.
frequently asks or demands staff's personal car keys, but has not used a weapon previously. Collin
returned the kitchen knife to Ilene, who locked up all sharp kitchen utensils at that time.
Later that evening, Ilene was dispensing night time medications.               (client) had gone downstairs with
a few other youth and             and was coming up the stairs shortly thereafter.            tripped on the stairs,
stumbled at the top and hit his knee on the cabinets across the landing. Ilene examined the knee, noted
it was slightly red, but there was not other apparent injury and              was walking normally without pain.
        (client) had continued to verbally assault Ilene through out the afternoon and evening at
intervals and had begun to do so again. At the same time                 advised that he had hurt his foot at the
park so badly that he couldn't lace his shoe up and needed to go to the ER. When Ilene examined the
injury, she did note that it was red and appeared to be slightly swollen. She gave him ice and explained
they would watch it to see if it was necessary to go to the ER.              continued to walk around normally
after that without any indication of pain.             (client) advised he had hurt his shoulder while out
playing football as well. Ilene and Collin decided that Ilene would take               and         to the ER and
bring another un-involved youth,              as well.        began to cause a scene about needing to go as well

been walking normally until that point.                       and       were given their shoes and taken outside

followed Ilene's instruction to return inside and she watched while he entered the home. Collin
contacted Moose, house manager, and advised him of the situation. Moose responded to the RTC.
Ilene drove to the American Fork Emergency Room and parked the van.                      who was sitting on the
first bench directly behind the drivers seat, leaned forward and took the keys out of the ignition. Ilene
was surprised and grabbed the end of the lanyard that the keys were on. She held the lanyard and
held the keys. Ilene prompted              to give the keys back to her, which he ignored. Collin called Ilene to
check in and overheard the goings on.                demanded that Ilene let go of the lanyard and ""get the fuck
out"", she continued to hold on to the lanyard and attempted to talk to                  He told her that ""it was
already a felony, so there was no turning back"". Ilene explained that he hadn't done anything yet, that
he didn't need to, etc. She continued to attempt to verbally de-escalate the situation, but
behavior continued to escalate. While Collin was still on the phone,                threatened to stab
(client) if Ilene didn't let go of the keys.         didn't take the threat seriously at first, but


continued to make it. Ilene didn't see any weapon, but knew that he had made the same threat to Collin
earlier in the evening.         continued to escalate becoming more and more aggressive and seemed to
be more and more desperate. Ilene, still holding the lanyard, disconnected with Collin and attempted to
call 911.         lunged forward attempting to get her phone. Ilene pulled the phone out of his reach
telling him not to touch it.        continued to escalate and became more and more aggressive in his
threats toward           Concerned for        safety, Ilene advised him to exit the van, which he did leaving
the side door open. Ilene then got out of the van herself, letting go of the lanyard, but talking to

started the car, and pulled out of the parking lot at a reckless speed. The side door of the van was still
open and           made no visible attempt to get out of the van, nor to stop           Ilene and        were
left at the ER and contacted the police.

out of the van and stay at the RTC. He also attempted to talk to           and         and get them to turn

of the van in an attempt to stop them, but           swerved to miss him and pulled out of the lane. Collin
